# Workshops
There were different workshops, like: 

* What is a particle?
* TIKZ
* Version Control with Git
* Minimizing with Python
* ...

One of the workshops was "Introduction to Boosted Decision Trees - A multivariate approach to classification problems":

In times of ever growing amounts of data and meta-data it is simply not possible to analyse this vast mass by hand effectively. Multivariate techniques offer an elegant way to cope with this issue and are already a common tool in complex fields like particle physics.
One is often required to sort a dataset into two groups, a so called classification. Depending on the problem these groups could be either yes or no, male or female, signal or background. Multivariate methods take advantage of internal correlations between given input variables and this classification variable to predict the likely outcome.
The focus of this session will be on Boosted Decision Trees, a powerful but nevertheless still easily understandable method for classification problems. As an introduction we will show problems and how exactly multivariate methods are able to solve them. Furthermore a demonstrative example how to approach a classification problem and how to solve it effectively using Boosted Decision Trees will be provided.
